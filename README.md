# AutoItScripts

This repository contains a collection of scripts for the [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com) software tool that automate interactions with different laboratory instruments for high-throughput experimental measuremnts and also for automated data analysis.
The scripts are designed to work with specific configurations of software tools and instruments and are by no means generalized.
However, hopefully the scripts can work as a starting point for others to customize for use in their own lab.
